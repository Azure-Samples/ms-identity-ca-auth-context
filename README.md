## Overview

This code sample uses the Conditional Access Auth Context to demand a higher bar of authentication for certain high-privileged operations in a Web API.

## Scenario

1. The client ASP.NET Core Web App uses the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to sign-in and obtain a JWT access token from **Azure AD**.
2. The access token is used as a bearer token to authorize the user to call the ASP.NET Core Web API protected **Azure AD**.

![Overview](./ReadmeFiles/topology.png)

## Prerequisites

- Either [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started)
- An **Azure AD** tenant. For more information see: [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant)
- A user account in your **Azure AD** tenant. This sample will not work with a **personal Microsoft account**. Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a personal account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

## Setup

### Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Register the sample application(s) with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There are two projects in this sample. Each needs to be separately registered in your Azure AD tenant. To register these projects, you can:

- follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

> :warning: If you have never used **Azure AD Powershell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.

1. On Windows, run PowerShell as **Administrator** and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. If you have never used Azure AD Powershell before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   cd .\AppCreationScripts\
   .\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

</details>

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

### Register the service app (TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `https://localhost:44351/`.
     > Note that there are more than one redirect URIs used in this sample. You'll need to add them from the **Authentication** tab later after the app has been created successfully.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. In the app's registration screen, select **Authentication** in the menu.
   - If you don't have a platform added, select **Add a platform** and select the **Web** option.
   - In the **Redirect URIs** section, enter the following redirect URIs.
      - `https://localhost:44351/signin-oidc`
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left to open the page where we can generate secrets and upload certificates.
1. In the **Client secrets** section, select **New client secret**:
   - Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),
   - Select one of the available key durations (**In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**) as per your security posture.
   - The generated key value will be displayed when you select the **Add** button. Copy the generated value for use in the steps later.
   - You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Select the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
   - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, select **Microsoft Graph**
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **Policy.Read.ConditionalAccess**, **Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Expose an API** blade to the left to open the page where you can declare the parameters to expose this app as an API for which client applications can obtain [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) for.
The first thing that we need to do is to declare the unique [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) URI that the clients will be using to obtain access tokens for this Api. To declare an resource URI, follow the following steps:
   - Select `Set` next to the **Application ID URI** to generate a URI that is unique for this app.
   - For this sample, accept the proposed Application ID URI (`api://{clientId}`) by selecting **Save**.
1. All APIs have to publish a minimum of one [scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code) for the client's to obtain an access token successfully. To publish a scope, follow the following steps:
   - Select **Add a scope** button open the **Add a scope** screen and Enter the values as indicated below:
        - For **Scope name**, use `access_as_user`.
        - Select **Admins and users** options for **Who can consent?**.
        - For **Admin consent display name** type `Access TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi`.
        - For **Admin consent description** type `Allows the app to access TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi as the signed-in user.`
        - For **User consent display name** type `Access TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi`.
        - For **User consent description** type `Allow the application to access TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi on your behalf.`
        - Keep **State** as **Enabled**.
        - Select the **Add scope** button on the bottom to save this scope.

#### Configure the service app (TodoListService-aspnetcore-webapi) to use your app registration
